          VoyaLoom is an AI travel album generator. You upload the photos from a trip and VoyaLoom
          uses AI to analyze, organize, curate, and describe them, then arranges everything into a
          scrollable cinematic story. It does the work you'd otherwise do by hand — sorting hundreds
          of photos, choosing the best ones, writing captions, and designing a layout.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-sand/60 font-light leading-relaxed">
          VoyaLoom works only with the photos you upload. It does not generate AI images or replace
          your travel photos with artificial ones.
