# Auth

BFF-style auth against the backend at `API_URL` (`/api/v1/auth/*`).

## How it fits together

```
interface/auth.ts        types + ApiError (shared)
services/
  env.server.ts          reads API_URL / SESSION_SECRET (server-only)
  http.server.ts         JSON fetch wrapper → normalises errors to ApiError
  auth.service.ts        backend calls: register / login / refresh / googleCallback / health
  session.server.ts      sealed (AES-encrypted, httpOnly) cookie holding the token pair
  auth.functions.ts      createServerFn RPC boundary the client calls
lib/auth/
  guards.ts              requireAuth / requireGuest for route beforeLoad
  use-auth.ts            client hook: user + login/register/logout
  use-current-user.ts    reads user from root route context
  google.ts              builds the public Google redirect URL
components/auth/
  Auth0Provider.tsx      Auth0 SPA provider and refresh-token setup
routes/auth.auth0.callback.tsx
                          Auth0 callback → sealed app session
```

## Token handling

The browser never sees the access or refresh token. `login`/`register` store both
inside an encrypted, signed, `httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie
(`voyaloom_session`). `getAuthenticatedUser()` transparently refreshes the access
token via `/api/v1/auth/refresh` when it is close to expiry, and clears the
session if the refresh token is rejected.

The current user is resolved once per navigation in `routes/__root.tsx`
`beforeLoad` and placed on route context. Call `router.invalidate()` after any
auth mutation to re-sync guards and `useCurrentUser`.

## Config

Set in `.env` (see `.env.example`):

- `VITE_API_URL` – public, used only for the Google full-page redirect.
- `API_URL` – server-only backend base URL (defaults to `VITE_API_URL`).
- `SESSION_SECRET` – ≥32 chars, encrypts the session cookie. `openssl rand -hex 32`.

## Auth0

The login and signup pages use Auth0 Universal Login. Auth0 returns an access
token for `VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE`; the callback sends that token through a
same-origin server function, where it is stored in the sealed session cookie.
Protected server functions then forward it as:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <Auth0 access token>
```

The backend must validate the token on every protected endpoint using the Auth0
tenant's JWKS, issuer (`https://<domain>/`), and configured API audience. It
must also enforce scopes/permissions for each operation. A frontend session or
user object must never be treated as proof of authorization.

Required Auth0 application settings:

- Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:8080/auth/auth0/callback` and the production equivalent.
- Allowed Logout URLs: the local and production app origins.
- Allowed Web Origins: the local and production app origins.
- Enable whichever Auth0 connections and authentication methods you want to expose in Universal Login.

Required environment variables are listed in `.env.example`:

- `VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`
- `VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE` (must match the backend API identifier)
- `VITE_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI`

The backend also needs to accept Auth0 JWTs on `/api/v1/trips`, album/image,
pricing, and analysis endpoints. Local username/password and custom Google
authentication endpoints are no longer used by this application.
